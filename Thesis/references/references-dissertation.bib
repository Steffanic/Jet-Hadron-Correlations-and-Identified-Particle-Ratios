  abstract = {We present results for pseudo-critical temperatures of QCD chiral crossovers at zero and non-zero values of baryon (B), strangeness (S), electric charge (Q), and isospin (I) chemical potentials μX=B,Q,S,I. The results were obtained using lattice QCD calculations carried out with two degenerate up and down dynamical quarks and a dynamical strange quark, with quark masses corresponding to physical values of pion and kaon masses in the continuum limit. By parameterizing pseudo-critical temperatures as Tc(μX)=Tc(0)[1−κ2X(μX/Tc(0))2−κ4X(μX/Tc(0))4], we determined κ2X and κ4X from Taylor expansions of chiral observables in μX. We obtained a precise result for Tc(0)=(156.5±1.5) MeV. For analogous thermal conditions at the chemical freeze-out of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, i.e., μS(T,μB) and μQ(T,μB) fixed from strangeness-neutrality and isospin-imbalance, we found κ2B=0.012(4) and κ4B=0.000(4). For μB≲300 MeV, the chemical freeze-out takes place in the vicinity of the QCD phase boundary, which coincides with the lines of constant energy density of 0.42(6)GeV/fm3 and constant entropy density of 3.7(5)fm−3.}
